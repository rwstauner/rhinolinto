A simple runtime configurable jslint using rhino.

Download local copies of:
  - rhino from Mozilla
  - jslint (rhino-edition) from jslint.com

Use those to run jslint on supplied javascript files,
and allow jslint options to be passed in via a JSON file.
Eventually options will probably be able to be specified on the command line as well.
